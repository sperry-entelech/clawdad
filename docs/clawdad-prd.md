## 1. Offer Definition

### What We Sell

Production deployment of OpenClaw autonomous AI agents for B2B companies. Not a chatbot. Not a demo. A system that runs 24/7, handles real work, and integrates with their existing operations.

### The Honesty Positioning

OpenClaw is proprietary, new, and actively evolving technology. This is not a mature SaaS product with 10 years of case studies. This is bleeding-edge deployment of frontier AI capability.

**Why honesty is the positioning:**
- Our actual ICP isn't every mid-market company — it's the ones who already understand autonomous agents are coming and want to move first
- These buyers don't need to be sold on AI. They need to be sold on us being competent enough to handle the risk
- "We're honest about what this is" differentiates from every agency claiming they've done hundreds of deployments
- Early adopters respect transparency. They want a partner who tells them what they're getting into, not one who hides it
- "You're getting in early while your competitors are still waiting for someone to tell them it's safe" — that's the pitch

**What we never claim:**
- Hundreds of deployments (we haven't done them)
- Guaranteed ROI timelines (the tech is too new)
- Case studies from fake personas
- Maturity that doesn't exist

**What we do claim:**
- Technical capability to deploy OpenClaw in production (Haithem has done it)
- Understanding of the business workflows that benefit from autonomous agents
- Honest assessment of what works and what's still experimental
- Early access pricing while we build our client base

## 4. Landing Page — What Needs to Change

### Current State (clawdad-site repo)
The site looks great visually. Black + amber, clean design, good page structure. But the copy makes claims we can't back:
- "Hundreds of deployments" energy when we have zero clients
- Fake proof quotes from fictional personas ("B2B SaaS Founder", "Wholesaler, TX")
- $150 discovery / $1,500-2,500 build pricing (outdated)
- No mention of the technology being new/proprietary
- Proof points bar with fabricated metrics ($200K → $130/mo, $41K in week 1, etc.)

### What Stays
- Visual design (black + amber + Inter font)
- Page structure (hero, problem, solution, agent configs, how it works, FAQ, CTA)
- Component architecture (modular, clean code)
- Brand name and identity

### What Changes
- All copy updated to reflect honest positioning
- Proof quotes removed or replaced with honest framing
- Pricing updated to $9K / $1,600
- New section or language about the technology being frontier
- Agent configs kept but reframed as "starting architectures" not proven playbooks
- Discovery call stays but pricing model adjusted

### Updated Page Sections

**Hero:**
- Headline: Keep "We deploy the agents. You close the deals." or test alternatives
- Subhead: Reframe from "Setup in days" to something that acknowledges the frontier nature
- Add: "Early access pricing for forward-thinking companies"

**Problem:**
- Keep the three pain points (setup complexity, security risks, most never launch)
- These are honest and accurate

**Solution:**
- Keep the bridge visualization
- Add honest framing: "We've done the hard work of learning this technology so you don't have to"

**Agent Configs:**
- Keep as starting architectures
- Remove fake proof quotes
- Replace with honest framing: "Based on the most common workflows we're designing for"

**Proof Points:**
- Remove entirely OR replace with honest metrics:
  - "$9K" / "flat setup"
  - "2-4 weeks" / "to running agents"
  - "$1,600/mo" / "ongoing support"
  - "24/7" / "autonomous operation"

**How It Works:**
- Update pricing in each step to match $9K setup / $1,600 retainer
- Keep the 4-step process

**FAQ:**
- Update "What is OpenClaw?" to include honest assessment of maturity
- Add FAQ: "Is this technology proven?" with honest answer
- Update pricing references

**CTA:**
- Keep discovery call model
- Update to reflect new pricing
- Add "early access" / "first cohort" language

## 8. Open Questions

1. **Which vertical?** Waiting on Haithem.
2. **Haithem's $750M company status?** Need update.
3. **Can we reference his work?** Even vaguely — "deployed for a large enterprise" adds credibility.
4. **Domain:** Keep clawdad domain or subdomain of ntelech?
5. **Demo environment:** Can Haithem provide a sandboxed demo?
6. **Revenue split formalization:** Written agreement needed before first payment.
