# Ntelech — What We're Building

**February 2026**

---

## The Short Version

We deploy AI systems for B2B companies — autonomous agents, outbound pipelines, and operational automation. Pre-revenue, building in public, looking for technical partners, small infrastructure funding, and early clients.

---

## Why B2B, Not Consumer

Consumer AI adoption is rising but it's a trap for builders. If you vibe code an AI consumer app, you'll very likely fall on your face. The space is flooded with shiny objects and the retail adoption wave will mostly flunk.

B2B is different. Companies have procurement budgets specifically for these experiments because the volatility cuts both ways — the upside is enormous and they can absorb the risk. Commercial deployment is the only viable path right now for operators who aren't sitting on venture capital.

We're building for the companies that have budget, need results, and can't deploy this stuff themselves.

## The Offers

### 1. Clawdad — DFY OpenClaw Agent Deployment

Deploy production autonomous AI agents using OpenClaw — proprietary, bleeding-edge technology that's actively evolving. We're honest about that. Clients who work with us understand they're getting frontier capability and inheriting frontier risk. That's the trade, and it's a good one — they're in before their competitors even know this exists.

- **ICP:** Mid-market B2B, $2-15M revenue, repetitive operational workflows
- **Price:** $9,000 setup + $1,600/mo retainer
- **Delivery:** Technical partner handles build, we handle strategy and client
- **Status:** Technical capability proven. Partner has production OpenClaw running, was in talks with $750M/year company (status pending). Landing page built, deploying this week. Finalizing target vertical.

### 2. DFY Outbound Appointment Engine — Pipeline on Autopilot

We build and run your entire outbound system. You tell us what you sell in 5 minutes. We do everything else. You show up to meetings.

No audits. No hour-long discovery sessions where we ask you to reveal your entire business to a stranger for a piece of paper. We do 99% of the work and deliver a clear, quantifiable outcome: booked appointments on your calendar.

- **ICP:** Service businesses with high-ticket recurring contracts, low digital sophistication
- **Price:** $4-6K/mo retainer
- **Delivery:** Strategy + copy in-house, infrastructure via partner, fulfillment outsourced
- **Margins:** 80-90% at scale
- **Status:** Infrastructure exists (120K sends/mo capacity, proven 42-54% open rates). Validated market — lots of competition, which means lots of demand. Vertical selection in progress.

### 3. Community / AI Founder OS — Free Audience Engine

Free or near-free ($1-2/mo) community and content ecosystem. Not a revenue line. The entire purpose is traffic and audience — funnels to higher-ticket offers.

Quiz funnel generates a context profile for each person. They get a custom package of resources (prompts, templates, build tutorials, swipe files) they can use solo, use with AI, or bring to us for implementation.

Community members build internal tools together — agents for accountability, learning, tracking. All information is free. Revenue comes from the funnel to paid offers, not from the community itself.

- **Status:** AI Founder OS repo published. No community created yet. Needs content production proposal with collaborators. Lowest priority — builds after Offers 1-2 generate revenue.

### Consulting Practice (Catch-All)

AI strategy and revenue operations for companies that don't fit a productized box. Project-based, $2-15K+. No audits — we scope specific deliverables with clear ROI.

## What We Need

### Small Infrastructure Funding

Not raising a round. Looking for small funding to stay largely bootstrapped but get boots on the ground:

- Finish GTM engineering for adjacent offers (landing pages, funnels, SOPs)
- Get data from the market (scraping tools, list building, sending infrastructure)
- Build feedback loops between offers and funnels
- Fill pipeline with leads via basic email campaigns
- Domains, hosting, basic tooling (~$500-1,500 to start)

### People

| Role | What They'd Do | Why We Need Them |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Vibe engineers | Implement service deliverables (OpenClaw deployment, automation builds, integrations) | We can sell and scope — need people who can build |
| Vibe marketers | Create content, run funnels, build audience for community engine | Traffic without paying for ads |
| Capital + sales taste | Fund basic infrastructure AND help close deals | Small money + GTM instinct > big money with no context |
| Content creators | Produce community content (videos, tutorials) | Coordinate via Apex, scale the free audience engine |

### The Team Vision

Small core team with ambassadors. Not an agency model — a lean operating company with partner-funded fulfillment capacity. Largely bootstrapped with small strategic funding to accelerate time-to-market.

## The Operator

**Sperry** — Strategy, GTM, client management, positioning, cross-departmental orchestration.

Surface-level skill across most domains (sales, marketing, copy, dev, automation, design, community). Deep expertise in first-principles strategic thinking and building businesses from a bird's eye view. Not a one-call closer. Not a specialist. The person who sees how all the pieces fit and coordinates the people who execute each piece.

Can configure and crowdsource to fulfill a big deal if closed. Not limited by capability — limited by cash and infrastructure. This translates to hiring and operations as the company grows.

Six years studying online business. Built systems for TNT Limousine (automation, CRM, cold email, web, GBP). Understands how revenue operations, marketing, and AI connect at the business level.

**Haithem (DarkZ)** — Technical delivery. OpenClaw deployment, SEO/GEO, cold email infrastructure, web development. Was in talks to deploy for a $750M/year company on B2B agent setup. Covers infrastructure costs currently.

**Adjacent:**
- Damian (Agent Integrator) — AI dev studio CEO, 41K audience, potential distribution + dev capacity
- Apex — Content distribution, community growth (activate post-traction)
