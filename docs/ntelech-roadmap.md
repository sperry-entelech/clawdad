# Ntelech — Master Roadmap

**Last Updated:** February 25, 2026
**Status:** Pre-revenue, MVG sprint
**Primary Operator:** Sperry
**Technical Partner:** Haithem (DarkZ)

---

## What Ntelech Is

A B2B services company that deploys AI systems generating revenue or eliminating operational drag for mid-market companies. Not an agency. Not a dev shop. A consulting practice with productized service arms and an audience-building engine underneath.

The thesis: consumer AI adoption is a trap — if you vibe code a consumer AI app you'll very likely fall on your face. B2B has procurement budgets for these experiments because of sheer volatility and lucrativeness. Commercial deployment is the only viable path right now. Retail adoption will flunk.

## Brand Architecture

```
Ntelech (parent company)
├── Clawdad — DFY OpenClaw agent deployment (proprietary tech, bleeding edge)
├── AgentSmith / Ntelech B2B — mid-market AI consulting + custom implementations
├── [TBD Name] — DFY outbound appointment engine
├── [TBD Name] — AI SEO/GEO optimization play
└── Community / AI Founder OS — free audience engine, funnels to paid offers
```

**Ntelech** is the overarching entity. Individual brands serve specific buyer types and maintain their own positioning. Agents can traverse context between all offers.

## The Offers

### Offer 1: Clawdad — DFY OpenClaw Agent Deployment (PRIMARY with Haithem)

**What it is:** Done-for-you deployment of autonomous AI agents using OpenClaw for mid-market B2B companies. Setup, configuration, integration, training, ongoing optimization.

**Critical positioning note:** OpenClaw is proprietary, new, and actively evolving technology. This is bleeding-edge deployment. Clients who choose Clawdad must understand they're buying frontier capability AND inheriting frontier risk. This is a feature, not a bug — they're getting in while competitors are still waiting for someone to tell them it's safe. Honesty about this IS the differentiation.

**Who it's for:**
- Mid-market B2B companies ($2-15M revenue, 10-100 employees)
- Industries with repetitive operational workflows
- Companies that know they need autonomous agents but can't deploy themselves
- Verticals: TBD — finalizing with Haithem (candidates: SaaS customer support, professional services, logistics, property management, managed IT)

**What they get:**
- Full OpenClaw production deployment
- 24/7 autonomous agent(s) — customer support, email management, voice, workflow-specific
- Integration with existing stack
- Team training + documentation
- Ongoing optimization and support

**Pricing:**
- Setup: $9,000
- Monthly retainer: $1,600/mo
- Custom implementations: scoped separately

**Delivery:**
- Haithem: Technical build, infrastructure, SEO/web
- Sperry: Strategy, sales, client management, positioning
- Revenue split: TBD (historically discussed 50/50, needs formalization)

**Current status:**
- Haithem has production OpenClaw running
- Was in talks with $750M/year company for B2B OpenClaw work — STATUS UNKNOWN, need update
- Landing page built (clawdad-site repo, Next.js + Tailwind, deploying tonight)
- No closed clients yet
- Need to finalize vertical and get Haithem's use cases

**What's needed to activate:**
- Final vertical selection (Haithem provides use cases for 2-3 industries)
- Update from Haithem on $750M company status
- Landing page copy updated to reflect honest positioning (no fake proof points)
- Formalize revenue split before first client payment
- 10-20 targeted outreach messages

---

### Offer 2: DFY Outbound Appointment Engine (Validated Market, High Competition)

**What it is:** We build and run your entire outbound pipeline. Lead scraping, cold email infrastructure, copy, sequencing, appointment booking. Client shows up to meetings.

**Market context:** This is one of the biggest and most prominent offers in the B2B services space right now. Lots of competition — but that means validation and easy to apply taste/differentiation to it.

**Philosophy (Nick Saraev principle):** No audits. No "let us analyze your business for an hour and give you a roadmap." That's high friction, unclear ROI, and asks the prospect to give away sensitive info to a stranger. Instead: we do 99% of the work. We need 5 minutes of info from them (what they sell, price points, customer journey). Then we deliver tangible outcomes: "20 booked appointments in 60 days." Clear and quantifiable.

**Who it's for:**
- Service businesses with high-ticket recurring contracts
- Low digital sophistication, dependent on referrals
- Vertical: TBD — validating (candidates: commercial cleaning, staffing, managed IT, commercial insurance brokers)

**What they get:**
- Lead list building and scraping
- Cold email infrastructure (domains, warmup, sending platform)
- Copy and sequencing
- Weekly reporting
- Appointment setting and pipeline management
- Qualified meetings on their calendar

**Pricing:**
- $4,000–$6,000/mo retainer
- Or: $2,000 setup + $3,000/mo + performance bonus per closed deal

**Delivery:**
- Sperry: Strategy, copy, client management
- Haithem: Infrastructure (sending systems, technical setup)
- Fulfillment hire: $600–$1,000/mo for scraping, sending, qualifying (post-revenue)

**Margins:** 80-90% at scale with outsourced fulfillment

**Current status:**
- Infrastructure exists (Haithem has 120K sends/mo capacity, 42% open rates)
- Proven copy skills (54% open rate on TNT campaign)
- No vertical locked, no active clients

**What's needed to activate:**
- Pick vertical and validate (scrape 50 companies, assess digital sophistication)
- Build landing page
- Run pilot campaign (500 emails) to prove deliverability + response rate
- First case study from pilot

---

### Offer 3: Community / AI Founder OS (Audience Engine — NOT Revenue)

**What it is:** Free (or near-free, $1.99/mo) community and content ecosystem. The entire point is to garner audience. Nothing more. Not a revenue line — a traffic source.

**What it could be:**
- Massive swipe file for $1 (prompts, templates, context files, build tutorials)
- Free Skool or Discord community
- Funnels to higher-ticket async info: upmarket protocols, specific build tutorials with assets
- Quiz funnel → context profile → custom package of resources tailored to the individual
- Community members can build internal tools together (agents for accountability, learning, tracking)
- AI Founder OS repo is the seed content

**Content strategy:**
- Sperry: longform YouTube talking head videos (largely unrelated to community — personal brand)
- Apex + content collaborators: community-specific content production (videos, tutorials, resources)
- Need a doc proposing the build for Apex — what to create, who creates it, distribution plan
- All information can be free. Revenue comes from the funnel, not the community.

**The tricky part:** Hard to advertise "AI for your specific situation" unless it's for a specific vertical (e.g., home renovation companies). The quiz funnel → context profile approach helps personalize, but broad positioning is harder to market than vertical-specific.

**Current status:**
- AI Founder OS repo exists with full project structure, skills, templates, expansion guides
- No community created yet
- No quiz funnel built
- No content production pipeline

**What's needed to activate:**
- Revenue from Offers 1-2 to fund content production
- Proposal doc for Apex on content collaboration
- Quiz funnel that generates context profile
- Decision on vertical focus vs. generalist positioning
- This is lowest priority — build after Offers 1-2 have traction

---

### Consulting Practice (Catch-All)

**What it is:** Revenue operations and AI strategy consulting for companies that don't fit a productized box. Custom implementations, strategic advisory.

**Philosophy:** No audits. Deliver tangible things. If someone needs help, scope a specific deliverable with clear ROI — not "we'll look at your business and tell you what to do."

**Pricing:** Project-based, $2,000–$15,000+ depending on scope

**Delivery:** Sperry leads strategy, brings in technical partners as needed. Can crowdsource fulfillment for big deals if closed.

## Sperry's Skill Profile

**Surface-level across:** sales, marketing, copywriting, development, automation, design, community building. Never locked down in one sector — gotten feet wet in everything.

**Deep expertise in:** First-principles strategic thinking, cross-departmental orchestration, building businesses from a bird's eye view, translating between technical and business domains, operating system design for companies.

**Not:** A one-call closer. Haven't spent years in sales. Can work between all departments to varying degrees but not a specialist in any single execution domain.

**Translates to:** Hiring, operations, systems architecture. The person who sees how all the pieces fit and coordinates the people who execute each piece.

**Financial reality:** Can configure and crowdsource to fulfill a big deal if closed. Not limited by capability — limited by cash and infrastructure.

---

## Financial Reality (February 2026)

- Ntelech revenue: $0 (TNT $900 pending — first consulting revenue)
- Cash on hand: Minimal
- Infrastructure budget: ~$0 (Haithem covers technical costs)
- Income: Volleyball refereeing (part-time), TNT project
- Burn rate: ~$1,200/mo minimum (parents $800 + car/insurance)

**Implication:** Cannot fund tools, ads, or hires. Everything must be built with sweat equity, free tools, and partner-funded infrastructure until first deal closes. Need small funding to remain largely bootstrapped but get boots on ground.

---

## What Ntelech Needs (Funding & People)

### Infrastructure Funding (Small — Stay Bootstrapped)
- Finish GTM engineering for adjacent offers
- Get data from the market (scraping tools, sending infrastructure)
- Build feedback loops between offers and funnels
- Fill pipeline with leads via basic email campaigns
- Domains, hosting, basic tooling

### People Needed
- **Vibe marketers:** People who can create content, run funnels, build audience
- **Vibe engineers:** Technical implementers who can fulfill service offers (OpenClaw deployment, automation builds, integrations)
- **Capital + sales taste:** People with money who also understand go-to-market and can help close
- **Content creators:** For community content production (coordinate via Apex)

### Team Vision
Small core team with ambassadors. Not an agency model — a lean operating company with partner-funded fulfillment capacity. TBD on exact structure.

## Key Decisions Still Needed

1. **OpenClaw vertical** — Haithem needs to provide use cases. Then pick one.
2. **Haithem $750M company status** — Did he get hired? What does this mean for Clawdad?
3. **Revenue split with Haithem** — Needs formalization before first client.
4. **Appointment engine vertical** — Commercial cleaning, staffing, managed IT, insurance?
5. **Appointment engine brand name** — TBD.
6. **SEO/GEO offer brand name** — TBD.
7. **Community vertical focus vs. generalist** — Easier to market if vertical-specific.
8. **Damian relationship** — Referral partnership, co-delivery, or just networking?
9. **Apex proposal** — What's the content collaboration structure?

## Reference Work

| Project | Client | Status | Relevance |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|

| Cold email campaign | TNT (past) | 54% open rate | Proves outbound copy skill |

## Guiding Principles

1. Ship MVG, sell before you build the backend
2. No audits — deliver tangible outcomes with clear ROI
3. One vertical at a time, prove it, then replicate
4. Haithem handles technical, Sperry handles GTM and client
5. Community is for audience, not revenue
6. Honesty about bleeding-edge tech IS the positioning
7. B2B procurement budgets > consumer app gambles
8. Small funding to stay bootstrapped, not raise rounds
9. Post-revenue: hire fulfillment, build automations, scale what works
